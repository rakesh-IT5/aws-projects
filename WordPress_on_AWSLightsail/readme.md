Deploying a WordPress Blog on AWS Lightsail 
AWS Lightsail is a cost-effective and beginner-friendly platform for deploying 
applications, including WordPress. Lightsail simplifies cloud hosting by providing 
pre-configured virtual private servers (VPS), making it ideal for WordPress blogs. 
Steps to Deploy WordPress on AWS Lightsail 
1. Sign in to AWS and Navigate to Lightsail 
● Go to AWS Lightsail Console. 
● Click on "Create instance" to set up a new server. 
2. Choose an Instance Location 
● Select the region closest to your target audience for better performance. 
3. Select an Instance Image 
● Choose "Apps + OS", then select WordPress (which comes pre-installed). 
● Alternatively, you can choose Linux/Unix + WordPress if you want more 
customization. 
4. Choose an Instance Plan 
● Select a pricing plan based on your expected traffic. 
● For a small blog, the $5/month plan is a good starting point. 
5. Name and Create the Instance 
● Give your instance a meaningful name (e.g., my-wordpress-blog). 
● Click "Create instance", and wait for AWS to provision it. 
6. Access Your WordPress Site 
● Once the instance is running, go to the Networking tab in Lightsail. 
● Copy the public IP address and paste it into your browser to open your 
WordPress site. 
7. Retrieve WordPress Admin Credentials 
● Connect to your instance using SSH (Click “Connect using SSH” in 
Lightsail). 
Run the following command to get your WordPress admin password: 
cat bitnami_application_password 
● Note the password and use it to log in at http://your-public-ip/wp-admin/. 
8. Configure Static IP (Recommended) 
● Go to the Networking tab and create a Static IP to prevent your site from 
changing its IP on reboot. 
● Attach the static IP to your instance. 
9. Configure a Custom Domain (Optional) 
● Register a domain from AWS Route 53 or any domain provider. 
● Update your domain’s A record to point to your static IP. 
10. Enable SSL for HTTPS (Recommended) 
Install a free SSL certificate using Let’s Encrypt with the following 
commands: 
sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool 
● Follow the prompts to enable HTTPS. 
11. Secure and Optimize WordPress 
● Update WordPress, themes, and plugins. 
● Use security plugins like Wordfence. 
● Optimize performance with caching plugins like W3 Total Cache or 
LiteSpeed Cache. 
12. Backup Your Instance (Recommended) 
● In Lightsail, go to the Snapshots tab and create a backup. 
● You can also enable automatic snapshots.
